# Horse Database
This page is meant to be a profile page for a horse. It's meant to allow a user to search for a horse by name and get a profile page with information about the horse.

## Data Sources
- [ATG API Calendar](https://www.atg.se/services/racinginfo/v1/api/calendar/day/2024-12-14)
- [ATG API Race](https://www.atg.se/services/racinginfo/v1/api/races/123456)

## Mission Brief
Extend this page to allow users to search for drivers and trainers. When a user searches for a driver or trainer the page should display all the horses they have trained or driven.

Add information about performances, results and records for the hoses displayed. Make the page look nice! Use Cursors built in functionality to do so.

If you have time over, make the input search field be easier to use by making it more resilient to spelling errors. Not sure how to proceed? Ask Cursor about string distance!
